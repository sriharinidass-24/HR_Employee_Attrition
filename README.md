## HR Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction ##
## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing HR data to understand employee attrition and predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization. The analysis includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning model building, and dashboard visualization using Power BI.

## Project Files

HR_Employee_Attrition.pdf → Full project report

HR_Employee_Attrition.py → Python code for data preprocessing, EDA, and model building

HR_Attrition_Dashboard.pbix → Power BI interactive dashboard

## Tools & Technologies

Python (pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

Power BI for dashboard creation

GitHub for version control and sharing

## Machine Learning Models Used

Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression + SMOTE

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

## Results

Random Forest achieved the highest overall accuracy (87.07%)

Decision Tree and Logistic Regression + SMOTE provided the best recall (43.59%) for identifying at-risk employees

The choice of model depends on whether HR prioritizes accuracy (Random Forest) or employee retention (Decision Tree / SMOTE-based Logistic Regression)

## Dataset

The dataset used is the IBM HR Employee Attrition Dataset, available on Kaggle
.
